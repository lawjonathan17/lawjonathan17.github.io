Portfolio Website

Inspired by Informatics 133's Project where we create our own portflio
website from scratch.

Overall Goal:
" To demonstrate an understanding of the importance of user research when
building interfaces. Designing and developing a portfolio (or similar
project) which utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The site you build must
be responsive or adaptive in regards to being displayed on mobile,
tablet and desktop devices. "

Website Build Requirements:
- At least 3 pages or sections linked together by navigation. You can
utilize a single page as long as you include navigation to at least three
distinct sections of the page.
- Usage of HTML5 semantic markup
- A way to contact you through the site (forms not required, link to your
school or outside email address will suffice).
- You must provide your full name in an "author" meta tag.
- Your name and image must be present on the site. 
- One of three pages or sections must be a personal bio with a description
of your interests and skills.
- Use of an external stylesheet for all of your styling.
- Use of internal or external JavaScript which adds meaningful functionality.
You are allowed to utilize a library (such as jQuery) or write plain
JavaScript. Demonstrate your knowledge but keep it simple.
- You must use at least three media queries. These should be set for
breakpoints that allows your content to be usable and accessible from a
mobile, tablet and desktop.
