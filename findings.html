            <h2>USER RESEARCH</h2>
            
            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <img src="images/user-interview.png">
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/spreadsheets/d/1ayDaQw9_sotSqouoObMqYvQ_U8a0ql0DQHzBzGzxrNc/edit?usp=sharing">View the user interviews</a>
            <p>User interviews are important to understand the type of people viewing the website and what they are looking to get out of looking at a developer's portfolio website. User interviews help the developer draw what type of information the audience wants to see and how to present them. Some of the questions asked were getting to know the user questions like "What is your current occupation?". To get a sense of what content to put I asked "What is the most important feature for the portfolio?" and "If you were to create your own portfolio website, what are some features you think would add value to it?"</p>
            
            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>

            <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/spreadsheets/d/1QK9UqQynu2rGbh-3_AZkrAaIvbbVskShfpu5uu5ljyU/edit?usp=sharing">View the competitor analysis</a>
            <p>A competitor analysis is understanding the competitors and knowing their strengths and weaknesses in relation to your own product. I reviewed other Computer Science students, UX designers, freelance web developers and my own LinkedIn account. I reviewed them to see what other students have built and what they are focusing on showing in their portflio since I am a student as well. I researched UX designers to see what a design-focused web developer would add to their portfolio website. I reviewed my LinkedIn website to get key features from a popular professional networking website.</p>
            
            <h3>Feature Value Matrix</h3>
            <img src="images/feature-value-matrix.png">
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/spreadsheets/d/1RgHngbFY0ngG4ijVe8I8BcZAbM5fd90ACP_G-WAww1U/edit?usp=sharing">View the feature value matrix</a>
            <p>A feature value matrix is an anaysis of features by focusing on their user or business value and how much effort it will take to complet each task. A feature value matrix is used to order tasks; where the focus is on high value, low effort tasks to complete first. Some of the features that I selected were the requirements of midterm part 2 where they had a high user value. Other features that I added were from looking at my competitor's portfolio website and drawing features that I liked and wanted to include in my own website. These features include: link to my resume, GitHub, and a way to contact me by email.</p>
            
            <h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>

            <p>Summary about how you prioritized the features and how this can be incorporated into building an interface. Be short and to the point. I prioritized my features based by increasing priority. For the Kano model, I prioritized the features based on their value and effort levels conducted from the feature value matrix. While building my interface I started from the tasks that had the most value and the least amount of effort to make then made my way to tasks that had more effort and less value. I referenced the feature prioritization chart a lot and went from right to left.</p>

            <p>User stories are used to capture the perspective of the end user with the product. User stories help find out what the user wants and how it is achieved with the product. Most of my most user stories were from the perspective of a Software Engineering Hiring Manager because that is the ideal audience of my website. I created the user stories by thinking as if I were a Software Engineering Hiring Manager and thinking about what features they look for and how to achieve them.</p>
            
            <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>

            <p>A cognitive walkthrough is where an user works through a series of tasks and is asked a set of questions. A cognitive walkthrough is important to understand the usability and learnability of the product by asking a user questions while they are navigating through the website. Cognitive walkthroughs can provide useful information for what the user likes about the product to use more of or what the user dislikes about the website to fix.</p>
            
            <h3>User Test</h3>

            <h2>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS</h2>
            <p>Before I started the implementation of my portfolio website I had to gather requirements of my target audience would want to see. From the user interviews I was able to conclude that projects and experience were a focus area for the content of my portfolio website. From the competitor analysis, I was able to retrieve some features that I liked and wanted to implement into my own website including: link to my GitHub and LinkedIn. Prioritizing the tasks from the feature value matrix and Kano model helped me organize my tasks on what to build first.
            <br><br>
            After the implementation, I was able to get feedback for the product that I built. Some of the feedback that I got from the cognitive walkthrough was to add more ways to add style to my website. My website looked a bit bland and needed some more of my personality in it. I also learned that I could add a skills section showing which technical skills that I know. The cognitive walkthrough also let me know that I had some spacing issues in my website that distracted the user's attention.
            <br><br>
            Some challenges that I faced while gathering these findings were thinking in the perspective of the user in terms of my product. It was challenging in that I had to use a new way of thinking to imagine that I was a hiring manager or another software engineer and I had to think about what that user would like. Another challenge was rating the values of features for the feature value matrix in terms of the user and business. Once again, I had to try to imagine what the user would want and try to think of what they would find valuable.

            <h2>INCORPORATION OF FINDINGS</h2>
            <p>My findings played a key role in my entire development process. I was able to find out what content to put from the user interviews where I created an about me, project and experience sections. I was able to organize my tasks in terms of which to complete first based on the feature value matrix and feature prioritization where it organized my time spent developing to tackle the most important features first. 
            <br><br>
            After my initial development, I was able to improve my interface based on my user testing. I was able to find useful,constructive feedback from the cognitive walkthrough that played a part in key improvements to my website. I got feedback that my website was a little bland and needed a better aesthetic feel so I made improvements to the font and added a background image. I was able to find out that I had a large gap when viewed on one of my user's devices so I was able to fix that. Some tasks that I want to implement in the future that was brought to my attention from the cognitive walkthrough is to add a skills section. I agreed with my user that it is important to add and would be beneficial to my portflio website.
            <br><br>
            Some challenges that I faced was improving the aesthetics of my webpage. I had to draw ideas from webpages that I thought looked nice and used their design in my own portfolio website.
