            <h2>USER RESEARCH</h2>
            
            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <img src="images/user-interview.png">
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/spreadsheets/d/1ayDaQw9_sotSqouoObMqYvQ_U8a0ql0DQHzBzGzxrNc/edit?usp=sharing">View the user interviews</a>
            <p>User interviews are important in the process of understanding the users of the product and their motives. The developer can draw information from user interviews about what type of content the audience wants to see and how to present them. Some of the questions I asked were getting to know the user questions like "What is your current occupation?", etc. To get a sense of what content to put on my portfolio website, I asked, "What is the most important feature for the portfolio?" and "If you were to create your own portfolio website, what are some features you think would add value to it?"</p>
            
            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <img src="images/competitor-analysis.png">
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/spreadsheets/d/1QK9UqQynu2rGbh-3_AZkrAaIvbbVskShfpu5uu5ljyU/edit?usp=sharing">View the competitor analysis</a>
            <p>A competitor analysis is a review of competing or similar web pages and finding their strengths and weaknesses. I reviewed other Computer Science students, UX designers, freelance web developers and my own LinkedIn account. I reviewed other students' webpages to find out what content is being presented by my immediate competitors for the jobs that I am trying to get. I researched UX designers to see what a more experienced web developer would add to their portfolio website. I reviewed my LinkedIn website to get key features from a popular professional networking website.</p>
            
            <h3>Feature Value Matrix</h3>
            <img src="images/feature-value-matrix.png">
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/spreadsheets/d/1RgHngbFY0ngG4ijVe8I8BcZAbM5fd90ACP_G-WAww1U/edit?usp=sharing">View the feature value matrix</a>
            <p>A feature value matrix is an analysis of features by rating them based on their user or business value and how much effort it will take to complete each task. A feature value matrix is used to order tasks; where the goal is to find high value, low effort tasks to complete first. Some of the features that I selected were the requirements of midterm part 2, where they had the highest user value. Other features that I added were from looking at my competitors' portfolio websites and drawing features that I liked and wanted to include in my own. These features include: a link to my resume, GitHub, and a way to contact me by email.</p>
            
            <h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>

            <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/presentation/d/1M5HYgdjDNw7yKzn7mEKkkQi3omdMpDlauT0ltfVudug/edit?usp=sharing">View the feature prioritization</a>
            <p>I prioritized my features in the "Feature Prioritization chart" by low-priority (left) to increasing priority (right). For the Kano model, I prioritized the features based on their value and effort levels conducted from the feature value matrix. While building my interface I started from the tasks that had the most value and the least amount of effort then made my way to tasks that had high value and more effort. Then I did the lowest value and high effort tasks last. I referenced the feature prioritization chart a lot and went from right to left. Using these charts while developing the interface of my site helped me manage my time and ensure that I had the most important features completed.</p>

            <h2>USER TESTING</h2>
            
            <h3>User Stories</h3>
            <img src="images/user-stories.png">
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/spreadsheets/d/1YWUL1Oj9P0O6nNB9_FMWtd_TSn6hgQD3GwoIiE8cdhs/edit?usp=sharing">View the user stories</a>
            <p>User stories are used to capture the perspective of the end user with the product. User stories help find out what the user wants and how it is achieved with the product. Most of my user stories were from the perspective of a Software Engineering Hiring Manager because that is the ideal audience of my website. I created the user stories by thinking as if I were a Software Engineering Hiring Manager and thinking about what features they look for and how to achieve them.</p>
            
            <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>
            <img src="images/cognitive-walkthrough.png">
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/spreadsheets/d/1v_qR9CK8G_fdgKccmJdfHhiXNnA1Bgf6cEECDBZOeUs/edit?usp=sharing">View the cognitive walkthrough</a>
            <p>A cognitive walkthrough is where a user works through a series of tasks and is asked a set of questions. A cognitive walkthrough is important to understand the usability and learnability of the product by asking a user questions while they are navigating through the website. Cognitive walkthroughs can provide useful information for what the user likes about the product, to use more of, or what the user dislikes about the website, to improve on.</p>
            
            <h3>User Test</h3>

            <p>I have one preference test comparing two different designs of my interface. I had redesigned my whole interface based on feedback from the cognitive walkthrough and I wanted to see if was worth the effort and that if I did improve my design. The result of this test was 100% on the redesign of the interface. The largest challenge that I faced in creating this user test was to complete the redesign of my interface first. I had to review other websites that I thought had good design and I had to implement them into my own webpage.
            <br><br>
            The second user test I created was to see where users would click if they wanted to see my projects. I was mainly trying to see if people would click on my GitHub which is where I wanted some users to click. The results of the user test were 100% on the "projects" label. The biggest challenge that I faced for this test was to improve on my interface based on the results of where the user clicked to view my projects. After this user test, I put links to my projects on GitHub in the projects setion to bring my users there.

            <h2>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS</h2>
            <p>Before I started the implementation of my portfolio website, I had to gather requirements based on what my target audience would want to see. From the user interviews, I was able to conclude that projects and experience were a focus area for the content of my portfolio website. From the competitor analysis, I was able to retrieve some features that I liked and wanted to implement into my own website including: fixed navigation bar, a link to my GitHub and LinkedIn. Prioritizing the tasks from the feature value matrix and Kano model helped me organize the development process so that the most important tasks were completed first.
            <br><br>
            After the implementation, I was able to get feedback for the product that I built. Some of the feedback that I got from the cognitive walkthrough was to add more ways to add style to my website. My website looked a bit bland and needed some more of my personality in it. I also learned that I could add a skills section showing which technical skills that I know. The cognitive walkthrough also let me know that I had some spacing issues in my website that distracted the user's attention. The user tests gave me information that my users liked my redesign a lot more than the original design and some certain aspects of it that looked nicer, such as the background image and nicer font.
            <br><br>
            Some challenges that I faced while gathering these findings were thinking in the perspective of the user reviewing my product. It was challenging in that I had to use a new way of thinking to imagine that I was a hiring manager or another software engineer and I had to think about what that user would like. Another challenge was rating the values of features for the feature value matrix in terms of the user and business. Once again, I had to try to imagine what the user would want and try to think of what they would find valuable.

            <h2>INCORPORATION OF FINDINGS</h2>
            <p>My findings played a key role in my entire development process. I was able to find out what content to put from the user interviews and competitor analysis. Where I created an about me, project and experience sections and drew features such as links to my GitHub, LinkedIn and a fixed navigation bar. I was able to organize my tasks in terms of which to complete first based on the feature value matrix and feature prioritization where it organized my time spent developing to tackle the most important features first. 
            <br><br>
            After my initial development, I was able to improve my interface based on my user testing. I was able to find useful, constructive feedback from the cognitive walkthrough that played a part in key improvements to my website. I got feedback that my website was a little bland and needed a better aesthetic feel so I made improvements to the font, added a background image and a fixed navigation bar. I was able to find out that I had a large gap when viewed on one of my user's devices so I was able to fix that. Some tasks that I want to implement in the future that was brought to my attention from the cognitive walkthrough is to add a skills section and how they specifically relate to the work that I have done. I agreed with my users that it is an important section to add and that it would be beneficial to my portflio website.
            <br><br>
            A challenge that I faced was improving the aesthetics of my webpage. I had to draw ideas from webpages that I thought looked nice and used their design in my own portfolio website.
