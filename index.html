            <h2>About</h2>
            <img id="selfie" src="images/jonathan-law.JPG">
            <p>Hello! I am a student at University of California, Irvine studying Computer Science. I am graduating in June 2018. I love programming because I am able to create whatever I want by solving problems and the possibilities of what to create are endless. I also enjoy challenging myself and watching myself grow as a result of overcoming the challenges. </p>
            <p>Outside of work, my hobbies include all things basketball (playing, watching, virtual, fantasy, shoes), listening to music, running, watching TV (Game of Thrones, Rick and Morty, Stranger Things), meditation, and coffee & tea.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>I learned web and Android development in my free time. My next goals are  to learn is iOS development since I use my iPhone a lot more than my tablet these days and to finish WebReg+ and start working on other Google Chrome Extensions.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>Garmin International</h3>
            <p>I have been a Software Engineer Intern at Garmin International since January 2017. I have been apart of the Automotive OEM Media Team. I learned and grown a lot during this internship. I learned how to approach complex problems; where at a first glance, the tasks used to seem almost impossible for me to do because I no experience with the system or environment and never faced as challenging of problems before. I learned to tackle these problems head on and to break them down to small, reachable parts to make the entire problem seem less intimidating. I learned how to debug code for commercial software. I solved bugs for the BMW Motorrad Navigator VI where my code gets to affect users around the world.</p>
